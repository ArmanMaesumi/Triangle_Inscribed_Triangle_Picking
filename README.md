Abstract. Given a triangle, we derive the probability distribution function and the moments of the area of an inscribed triangle whose vertices are uniformly and independently distributed on different sides of the given triangle. The theoretical results are confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation and explored using a computer algebra system. This article is intended for readers interested in geometric probability and multivariable calculus. A similar problem related to tetrahedrons provides an area of future research.

This repository contains the Java program that I wrote to verify my findings.
