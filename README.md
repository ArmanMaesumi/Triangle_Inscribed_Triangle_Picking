Abstract. Given a triangle, we derive the probability distribution function and the moments of the area of an inscribed triangle whose vertices are uniformly and independently distributed on different sides of the given triangle. The theoretical results are confirmed by a Monte Carlo simulation and explored using a computer algebra system.

This repository contains a Java program that experimentally verifies my theoretical results.
